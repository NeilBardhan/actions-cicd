# Job Artifacts

**Job artifacts** are the assets/outputs that are generated by the job. Since the most common jobs are usually `build` and `test`. The common artifacts generated are uually **distributable files** or **test coverage reports**.

Once a job finishes running on a runner VM, all artifacts generated during the job are destroyed as the runner VM is turned off/cleaned up. But, with GitHub Actions, we can persist these artifacts that are produced by a job for - 
  - Manually downloading them and reviewing them.
  - Automatically using them in subsequent jobs. For example, **pubishing a website after making content changes** or **publishing the package wheel files to pypi or artifactory after an update**.

**Files/Folders produced by a job that we want to manually inspect or use in subsequent jobs should be thought of as job artifacts.**
